# Personal package monorepo

This is a monorepository containing my personal packages.  At this time the
repository is merely meant for getting familiar with publishing my own packages
and monorepo's in general.  Currently, it consists of a small `numbers`
*library*.

## Packages

[`@hektormisplon/numbers`](packages/numbers/README.md)

## Installation

`npm i @hektormisplon/<package>`
