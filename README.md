# Personal packages

This is a monorepository containing my personal packages.  At this time the
repository is merely meant for getting familiar with publishing my own packages
and monorepo's.  Currently, it consists of a small `numbers` *library*.

## `@hektormisplon/numbers`

Library consisting of utilities for working with numbers.

Installation:

`npm i @hektormisplon/numbers`
